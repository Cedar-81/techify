# Techify

Techify is a tech event booking platform built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Radix. Its design has been inspired by dribbble.com and it aims to be simple yet effective for users to discover and book tech events in their area. Please note that Techify is still a work in progress and some features may not be fully implemented yet.
